    <p>
      Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, written by the duo SingShong tells the
      story of a 28 year old businessman, Kim Dokja, that read a novel called
      "Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World" over the span of a decade. One
      fateful day, the real world becomes the apocalyptic world of the novel.
      Kim Dokja tries to figure out why the world became this way and also how
      to survive using his extensive knowledge of the novel.

    <hr />
    <p>
      The first 4 films feature Sidney Prescott being hunted down by various
      different ghostfaces, their motivations including revenge, jealousy, a

      Carpenter during the 5th and 6th films within the franchise.
